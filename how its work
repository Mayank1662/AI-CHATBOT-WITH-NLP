 What it does:
Loads spaCy NLP model (en_core_web_md)

Loads the intents.json file which defines:

User message patterns

Predefined responses

Uses vector similarity to match user input to known intents

Replies with a random response for the best-matched intent

If nothing matches (below threshold), falls back with a generic message
